// Class - Movie

// The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

// title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
// studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
// rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

// a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class Movie{
    constructor(title,studio,rating){
        this.title=title,
        this.studio=studio
        // this.rating=rating
        // this.rating="PG"
        if(rating==null){
           this.rating="PG"
        }else{
           this.rating=rating
        }
    }
    getPG(arr){
        console.log("getPG method is called",arr)
        //only pg as a rating, that should be there
        let PGResult=[]
        for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            // console.log(arr[i].rating)
            if(arr[i].rating=="PG"){
                //console.log(arr[i].rating)
                //console.log(arr[i])
                PGResult.push(arr[i])

            }
        }
        console.log(PGResult)


    }
}
let movie1=new Movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG­13")
let movie2=new Movie("ABC","A Productions","PG")
let movie3=new Movie("DEF","D Productions")
let movie4=new Movie("XYZ","X Productions","PG­15")
let movie5=new Movie("LMN","L Productions")
let movie6=new Movie("TYU","T Productions","PG")
let movie7=new Movie("TYU","T Productions")


var array=[movie1,movie2,movie3,movie4,movie5,movie6,movie7]
console.log(array)

console.log(movie1)
movie4.getPG(array)
// [movie1,movie2]

// b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

// c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

// d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
